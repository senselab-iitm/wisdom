[<a href='https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1QzZPx9LiYrjlb1CArLRRkUAeOjM13ahV'>Datasets</a>] [<a href='https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1Tzo6rNLU8OlriODip4Zmgpos7e0sL9c9'>Models</a>] [<a href=''>Workshop Paper - TBA</a>] [<a href=''>Artifact Paper - TBA</a>] [<a href='http://cse.iitm.ac.in/~sense/wisdom'>Project Website</a>]

The GitHub repository only consists of the scripts. 
The dataset and models are present in publicaly on <a href='https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/13Crp-owAzkjZVH85AhisW9Yfi78wsoMf'>Google Drive</a>.
To know more about our work please read the <a href=''>workshop paper (TBA) </a> or check our <a href='http://cse.iitm.ac.in/~sense/wisdom'>project website</a>. 
To know more about the organisation of the project and how to use the datasets, models and script, please have a look at the <a href=''>artifact paper (TBA)</a> or the readme files present in the different sub-folders of the project.

Once you download the data and models put them inside the main wisdom folder i.e., wisdom will have three folder `data`, `models`, `scripts`, this will ensure the filepaths in the code to work properly.
